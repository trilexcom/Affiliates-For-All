Affiliates For All contains code and images from certain other open source
projects.  This file gives credit to these other open source projects and also
includes any legal notices which are required by their licence terms.

The Affiliates For All licence terms can be found in the file called COPYING.
The terms in COPYING apply to the whole of Affiliates For All, except for some
of the files which came originally from other projects; see below.

I would like to thank the authors of the packages whose code is included in
Affiliates For All.  Affiliates For All would have been a much poorer product
if you had not been generous enough to make your work open source.


Affiliates For All is subject to the following licence conditions.
